# VRChat-Discord-Mute
 
## Features

- Toggle mute in VRChat with a global hotkey.
- Toggle mute in Discord with VRChat gestures.

## Installation

Just download the latest release and run the executable.

## Build

Requires Cargo and Rust.

1. Clone the repository.
2. `cd` into root/vrchat-discord-mute
3. Run `cargo build --release` or just `cargo run`

## Issues

There's currently no configuration file, so you'll have to edit the source code to change the hotkeys.
